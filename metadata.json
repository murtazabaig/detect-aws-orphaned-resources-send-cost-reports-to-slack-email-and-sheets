  "description": "HOW IT WORKSThis workflow automatically scans AWS accounts for orphaned resources(unattached EBS volumes, old snapshots >90 days, unassociated Elastic IPs) thatwaste money. It calculates cost impact, validates compliance tags, and sendsmulti-channel alerts via Slack, Email, and Google Sheets audit logs.Key Features: * 🔍 Multi-region scanning with parallel execution * 💰 Monthly/annual cost calculation with risk scoring * 📊 Professional HTML reports with charts and tables * 🏷️ Tag compliance validation (SOC2/ISO27001/HIPAA) * ✅ Conditional alerting (only alerts when resources found) * 📈 Google Sheets audit trail for trend analysisWhat gets detected: * Unattached EBS volumes ($0.10/GB/month waste) * Snapshots older than 90 days ($0.05/GB/month) * Unassociated Elastic IPs ($3.60/month each)Typical savings: $50-10K/month depending on account sizeSET UP STEPSPREREQUISITESAWS Configuration: 1. Create IAM user n8n-resource-scanner with these permissions: * ec2:DescribeVolumes * ec2:DescribeSnapshots * ec2:DescribeAddresses * ec2:DescribeInstances * lambda:InvokeFunction 2. Deploy Lambda function aws-orphaned-resource-scanner (Node.js 18+) 3. Add EC2 read-only permissions to Lambda execution role 4. Generate AWS Access Key + Secret KeyLambda Function Code: See sticky notes in workflow for complete implementationusing @aws-sdk/client-ec2Credentials Required: * AWS IAM (Access Key + Secret) * Slack (OAuth2 or Webhook) * Gmail (OAuth2) * Google Sheets (OAuth2)CONFIGURATION 1. Initialize Config Node: Update these settings: * awsRegions: Your AWS regions (default: us-east-1) * emailRecipients: FinOps team emails * slackChannel: Alert channel (e.g., #cloud-ops) * requiredTags: Compliance tags to validate * snapshotAgeDays: Age threshold (default: 90) 2. Set Region Variables: Choose regions to scan 3. Lambda Function: Deploy function with provided code (see workflow sticky notes) 4. Google Sheet: Create spreadsheet with headers: * Scan Date | Region | Resource Type | Resource ID | Monthly Cost | Compliance | etc. 5. Credentials: Connect all four credential types in n8n 6. Schedule: Enable \"Weekly Scan Trigger\" (default: Mondays 8 AM UTC)TESTING 1. Click \"Execute Workflow\" to run manual test 2. Verify Lambda invokes successfully 3. Check Slack alert appears 4. Confirm email with HTML report received 5. Validate Google Sheets logging worksCUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS * Multi-region: Add regions in \"Initialize Config\" * Alert thresholds: Modify cost/age thresholds * Additional resource types: Extend Lambda function * Custom tags: Update required tags list * Schedule frequency: Adjust cron triggerUSE CASES * FinOps Teams: Automated cloud waste detection and cost reporting * Cloud Operations: Weekly compliance and governance audits * DevOps: Resource cleanup automation and alerting * Security/Compliance: Tag validation for SOC2/ISO27001/HIPAA * Executive Reporting: Monthly cost optimization metricsRESOURCES * AWS IAM Best Practices [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html] * Lambda Function Code [https://github.com/chadmcrowell/lambda-function-for-aws-orphaned-resource-scanner]",
